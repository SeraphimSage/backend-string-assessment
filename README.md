# String1 and String2

For this assignment, you'll be coding some string manipulation functions within the `string1.py` and `string2.py` files.

There is some light dependency on knowing how
[functions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions)
work in python in terms of argument passing and return values, but you should
be able to figure it out as you go.

## Instructions

Complete all of the functions in `string1.py` and `string2.py` based on your knowledge of Python strings, indexing, slicing, and methods. Make sure all the included tests are passing before submitting your work.

Run the programs from the command line like this:

```console
$ python string1.py
```

Here is a sample output. You can see that for the `donuts()` function, some tests are passing, others are failing.

```
$ python string1.py
donuts
 OK  got: 'Number of donuts: 4' expected: 'Number of donuts: 4'
 OK  got: 'Number of donuts: 9' expected: 'Number of donuts: 9'
  X  got: 'Number of donuts: 10' expected: 'Number of donuts: many'
 OK  got: 'Number of donuts: many' expected: 'Number of donuts: many'
